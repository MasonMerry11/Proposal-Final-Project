1. The title of my project will s*bert (so bsically because its a q*bert dupe, I will try to make it so stella the owl is the main character and the enemies can be opposing schools mascots)
2. The game will be a direct dupe of q*bert the retro game
3. The software will run like q*bert the retro arcade game. This version in unity however is run as a 3d model version of it. It will look a little strange because of the 3d aspect, but it adds more charcter to what the game originally was. It will be excecuted using unity. 
4. A good outcome of this final will be to learn how to do the basics in Unity when creating a game. 
5. A better outcome will be to have the game almost completely work, and learn almost everything I would need to know about creating a 3d game in unity.
6. The best possible outcome of this project will be to have it work 100 percent right on my first try and completely understand how the engine works, and with hopes of putting this project on me resume. 
7. I will need to acquire the skills to download softwares and files to get this game running properly, learning how to code in unity. I will need to research most likely tips and tricks in unity if the tutorial is not up front enough about it.
